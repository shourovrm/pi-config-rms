# pi-config-rms

Personal pi coding agent configuration — agents, extensions, skills, prompts, and workflow rules.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shourovrm/pi-config-rms.git
cd pi-config-rms
./setup.sh
```

**Prerequisites:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (npm) and [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) (`npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`).

`setup.sh` installs npm dependencies, copies settings, and fetches all external pi packages.
See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for details.

## Update

```bash
git pull && ./setup.sh
```

## Contributing Changes Back

After `setup.sh`, pi loads extensions, agents, and skills **directly from this clone directory**.
That means editing files here is editing your live pi config — no copying needed.

### Extensions, agents, skills

Edit files in the clone directory, then commit and push:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: describe your change"
git push
```

Run `/reload` in pi to pick up changes without restarting.

### Settings (model, theme, packages)

Settings live at `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (outside the clone). Sync them back:

```bash
cp ~/.pi/agent/settings.json pi-settings.example.json
git add pi-settings.example.json
git commit -m "chore: sync settings"
git push
```

## Quick Start: Using Agents

Agents are subagent role-cards. Use them via the `subagent` tool:

```
"Use the planner agent to create an implementation plan for this feature."
"Use the researcher to find the latest docs on X."
"Run the full-workflow chain to scout, plan, implement, and review this task."
```

Chain workflows orchestrate multiple agents in sequence:
- `full-workflow` — scout → plan → review plan → implement → review
- `scout-and-plan` — scout → plan → review plan
- `implement-plan` — implement a pre-made plan → review
- `quick-plan` — fast scout → plan (no review)

## Agents
